REQUIREMENTS

To develop the comprehensive sales chatbot for an e-commerce platform as described, you'll need to break down the project into specific tasks. Here's a detailed explanation of the requirements and the actions you'll need to take to fulfill them.

### 1. **User Interface / Front End**
The front-end part of this project is where users interact with the chatbot to explore products and make purchases. The front end should be responsive, user-friendly, and work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Actions:
- **Responsive Design:** Use modern JavaScript frameworks (such as React, Angular, or Vue.js) along with HTML5 and CSS for styling. The design should automatically adapt to different screen sizes (responsive design).
- **Chatbot Interface:**
  - Create a chatbox-like interface where users can interact with the chatbot. The interface should be simple, intuitive, and easy to use.
  - Include features such as:
    - **Conversation Reset:** A button to reset the chat, clearing the conversation history and allowing users to start a new session.
    - **Session Tracking:** Display timestamps for each user message and chatbot response.
    - **Product Presentation:** Display products fetched from the server in a clear and engaging format, including images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Login and Authentication:**
  - Implement a login system where users can securely log in and maintain session continuity.
  - Use authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or sessions to secure user data and interactions.
- **Session Continuity:** Track the session state to ensure users don’t lose progress when navigating the site or reloading the page.
  - Store session data in the browser using cookies, localStorage, or sessionStorage.
- **Data Storage for Chat Interactions:** Store all conversations and interactions to allow for analysis and retrieval later.
  - Use a local database (like SQLite) or an in-memory store like Redis for chat data storage.

### 2. **Backend**
The backend is responsible for processing requests, fetching product data, and handling the logic of the chatbot's responses.

#### Actions:
- **API-Driven Backend:** 
  - Use Python frameworks such as Flask or Django to build an API that processes user queries and returns relevant product data.
  - The API should be able to handle RESTful interactions (GET requests for fetching data, POST for user actions, etc.).
- **Product Database:**
  - Populate a relational database (like SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL) with at least **100 mock e-commerce product entries**. Each product should have attributes like:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Price
    - Category (electronics, books, etc.)
    - Image URL (for displaying the product in the UI)
    - Stock quantity
- **Search Logic:** 
  - Implement the search functionality to allow the chatbot to search for products by keyword (e.g., "laptop", "phone", etc.) or filter by category.
  - Allow the chatbot to suggest products based on the user's query.
- **Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling on the backend for cases like missing data, incorrect API requests, or server issues.

### 3. **Technical Documentation**
Documentation is crucial for explaining how the project works, how to set it up, and what technologies were used.

#### Actions:
- **Process Documentation:**
  - Explain the entire process from designing the chatbot to implementing the backend and connecting it with the front end.
  - Discuss the architecture of the system, including:
    - The flow of communication between the front end (chatbot) and the backend (API).
    - How product data is fetched from the database and displayed in the chatbot.
- **Choice of Tools/Frameworks:**
  - Justify why you chose specific frameworks (e.g., React for the front end, Flask for the backend).
  - Explain how these tools will help achieve project goals, focusing on scalability, performance, and ease of use.
- **Mock Data Creation:**
  - Include the process of creating and populating the mock product data (i.e., 100 sample product entries).
- **Challenges & Solutions:**
  - Describe any challenges faced during the development (e.g., designing an intuitive UI, implementing the backend logic) and how they were overcome.

### 4. **Code Quality and Best Practices**
This is an essential part of the project, as it ensures the system is maintainable, scalable, and robust.

#### Actions:
- **Clean and Readable Code:** Ensure your code is clean, readable, and follows industry standards. This includes:
  - Proper indentation.
  - Meaningful variable and function names.
  - Use of comments to explain complex logic.
- **Modular Architecture:** Break the code into small, reusable, and testable components.
  - Use components for the front end (React components, for example).
  - Keep backend logic modular, using services and controllers for different aspects of the application.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Ensure that the system handles edge cases gracefully (e.g., no products found, network failures).
  - Implement proper error handling in both the front end (handling API errors) and back end (validating user input).
  
### 5. **Evaluation Criteria**
The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

#### a. **UI User Experience:**
  - The user interface should be visually appealing while ensuring a seamless experience for users interacting with the chatbot.
  - The design should allow users to filter products, interact with the chatbot, and explore different products intuitively.

#### b. **Technical Implementation:**
  - The quality of your code (both front-end and back-end) is essential, including readability, structure, and modularity.
  - Ensure your application is functional, responsive, and well-organized.

#### c. **Innovation and Problem-Solving:**
  - Showcase creativity in solving the problem. This could include innovative ways to display products, enhance chatbot conversations, or integrate advanced search and filtering features.

#### d. **Documentation and Presentation:**
  - The technical documentation should be clear, detailed, and easy to understand. It should provide information on how to set up and run the project.
  - The presentation should concisely describe the project’s goals, technologies used, and key learnings.

### 6. **Deliverables:**
These are the items you'll need to submit as part of your project.

1. **GitHub Repository:**
   - A public GitHub repository containing all the source code for both the front end (chatbot UI) and back end (API).
   - The repository should include a detailed `README.md` with setup instructions, dependencies, and execution steps.

2. **Project Report:**
   - A detailed report outlining the technologies used, the structure of the project, how you implemented various features, and sample queries.
   - Discuss results obtained from sample queries, such as product search or filtering.

3. **Presentation:**
   - A presentation for a recruitment panel that covers the project’s objectives, your approach, the technologies you used, and what you learned throughout the process.
